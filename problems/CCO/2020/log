- first react: line sweep
- figure out where intervals intersect y = Y, sweep, for each range count how many friends you intersect
- propogate array
- consider list of doubles representing points
[0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.5]
- some are --#pts, others are ++#pts

how to find when some slope hits line

0 = slope(st x) + b

solve for b

10 = mx + b

- some greedy 

- go backwards, N must be last, then you can just do greedy + DS?
